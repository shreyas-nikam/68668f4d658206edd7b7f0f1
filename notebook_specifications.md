# Technical Specification: Jupyter Notebook for Depreciation Method Analyzer

## 1. Notebook Overview

**Purpose and Objectives:**
This Jupyter Notebook serves as an interactive educational tool designed to elucidate the concept of asset depreciation. Its primary objective is to allow users to calculate, visualize, and compare depreciation schedules generated by two fundamental accounting methods: the Straight-Line method and the Diminishing Balance method. By enabling dynamic input adjustments, the notebook aims to foster a deeper understanding of how different variables and methods impact annual depreciation expense and an asset's net book value over its useful life.

**Target Users and Learning Goals:**
The target audience for this notebook includes:
*   Finance and accounting students.
*   Individuals new to financial statement analysis.
*   Anyone seeking a practical, interactive understanding of depreciation concepts.

The notebook is structured to help users achieve the following learning outcomes, drawing directly from the provided document context:
*   **Understand the Concept of Depreciation:** Grasp "depreciation" as the systematic allocation of costs of long-lived physical assets over their useful life, as discussed in the "Issues in Expense Recognition: Depreciation and Amortization" section of the reference document.
*   **Calculate Straight-Line Depreciation:** Competently calculate annual depreciation expense using the straight-line method, which allocates cost less residual value evenly over the useful life.
*   **Calculate Diminishing Balance Depreciation:** Understand and calculate depreciation using an accelerated method like the diminishing balance method, applying a constant rate to the declining net book value of the asset.
*   **Analyze Sensitivity:** Analyze the sensitivity of depreciation expense to changes in estimated useful life and residual value, understanding their implications on financial reporting.

**Expected Outcomes and Value:**
Upon completion of this notebook, users will be able to:
*   Articulate the core principles of straight-line and diminishing balance depreciation.
*   Perform year-by-year depreciation calculations for both methods.
*   Visually interpret depreciation trends and net book value changes over time.
*   Compare the impact of different depreciation methods and input parameters on financial metrics (expense, book value).
*   Appreciate the implications of depreciation choices for financial analysis, particularly how method selection and estimates affect reported expense and net income, as highlighted in the document's "Implications for Financial Analysts: Expense Recognition" section.

## 2. Notebook Structure and Flow

The notebook will be logically structured into several sections, progressing from fundamental definitions to interactive analysis and comparison. Markdown cells will provide theoretical explanations, formulas, and guidance, while code cells will implement calculations, generate data, and produce visualizations.

**Suggested Sections and Flow:**

### **Section 1: Introduction to Depreciation**
*   **Markdown Cell (H1 Header):** "Introduction to Asset Depreciation"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Overview of the notebook's purpose, what depreciation is, and its importance in financial accounting. Reference "Issues in Expense Recognition: Depreciation and Amortization" from the document.
*   **Markdown Cell (H2 Header):** "Learning Objectives"
*   **Markdown Cell:** List the specific learning outcomes for the notebook.

### **Section 2: Core Depreciation Concepts**
*   **Markdown Cell (H1 Header):** "Fundamental Concepts and Terminology"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Define key terms such as:
    *   **Asset Cost:** The initial cost incurred to acquire and prepare the asset for use.
    *   **Useful Life ($N$):** The estimated period over which an asset is expected to be used by the entity.
    *   **Residual Value ($RV$):** The estimated salvage value of the asset at the end of its useful life.
    *   **Depreciable Base ($DBase$):** The amount of an asset's cost that can be depreciated.
        *   Formula: 
$$
\text{Depreciable Base} = \text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}
$$

    *   **Net Book Value ($NBV$):** The asset's cost less accumulated depreciation.

### **Section 3: Straight-Line Depreciation Method**
*   **Markdown Cell (H1 Header):** "Straight-Line Depreciation"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Explain the straight-line method as allocating the depreciable base evenly over the asset's useful life. Mention its simplicity and common use.
*   **Markdown Cell (H2 Header):** "Mathematical Formula"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Present the formula for annual straight-line depreciation expense:
    
$$
\text{Annual Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Estimated Useful Life}}
$$

    This formula ensures that the asset's cost, less its residual value, is systematically expensed over its useful life.
*   **Markdown Cell (H2 Header):** "Example Calculation (Straight-Line)"
*   **Code Cell:** Define example input parameters (cost, useful life, residual value).
*   **Code Cell:** Implement a Python function `calculate_straight_line(cost, useful_life, residual_value)` that calculates and returns a pandas DataFrame showing:
    *   Year
    *   Beginning Net Book Value
    *   Annual Depreciation Expense
    *   Accumulated Depreciation
    *   Ending Net Book Value

### **Section 4: Diminishing Balance Depreciation Method**
*   **Markdown Cell (H1 Header):** "Diminishing Balance Depreciation (Accelerated)"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Explain the diminishing balance method as an accelerated depreciation method, resulting in higher depreciation expense in early years and lower expense in later years. Explain that it applies a constant rate to the declining net book value.
*   **Markdown Cell (H2 Header):** "Mathematical Formulas"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Present the formulas involved:
    *   **Straight-Line Rate:**
        
$$
\text{Straight-Line Rate} = \frac{1}{\text{Useful Life}}
$$

    *   **Diminishing Balance Rate:** This rate is derived by multiplying the straight-line rate by an acceleration factor (e.g., 150%, 200%):
        
$$
\text{Diminishing Balance Rate} = \text{Acceleration Factor} \times \text{Straight-Line Rate}
$$

    *   **Annual Depreciation Expense:** Calculated by applying the diminishing balance rate to the *beginning-of-year net book value*.
        
$$
\text{Annual Depreciation Expense} = \text{Diminishing Balance Rate} \times \text{Beginning Net Book Value}
$$

        **Important Note:** Depreciation stops when the asset's net book value reaches its residual value. The last year's depreciation may be adjusted to ensure this.
*   **Markdown Cell (H2 Header):** "Example Calculation (Diminishing Balance)"
*   **Code Cell:** Define example input parameters (cost, useful life, residual value, acceleration factor).
*   **Code Cell:** Implement a Python function `calculate_diminishing_balance(cost, useful_life, residual_value, acceleration_factor)` that calculates and returns a pandas DataFrame identical in structure to the straight-line output.

### **Section 5: Interactive Depreciation Analyzer & Visualization**
*   **Markdown Cell (H1 Header):** "Interactive Depreciation Analyzer"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Introduce the interactive elements, allowing users to experiment with different parameters. Explain how inputs will drive real-time calculations and visualizations.
*   **Code Cell:** Import necessary libraries (`ipywidgets`, `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`).
*   **Code Cell:** Define `ipywidgets` for:
    *   `asset_cost`: Float slider or text input.
    *   `useful_life`: Integer slider or text input.
    *   `residual_value`: Float slider or text input.
    *   `acceleration_factor`: Float slider or dropdown (e.g., 1.5, 2.0).
    *   `depreciation_method`: Dropdown for "Straight-Line" or "Diminishing Balance".
*   **Code Cell:** Create a main interactive function that:
    *   Takes widget values as input.
    *   Calls the appropriate `calculate_` function based on the selected method.
    *   Displays the resulting depreciation schedule as a pandas DataFrame.
    *   Generates two interactive line charts:
        *   **Chart 1:** Annual Depreciation Expense over the asset's useful life.
        *   **Chart 2:** Net Book Value over the asset's useful life.
        *   Plots should include annotations/tooltips for data points (e.g., specific year's expense or book value).
*   **Code Cell:** Use `interact` or `interactive_output` from `ipywidgets` to link the widgets to the main function, ensuring dynamic updates.

### **Section 6: Comparative Analysis and Financial Implications**
*   **Markdown Cell (H1 Header):** "Comparative Analysis and Financial Implications"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Discuss the key differences observed between straight-line and accelerated methods. Highlight that "Under accelerated depreciation methods, there is a higher depreciation expense in early years relative to the straight-line method," as stated in the document.
*   **Code Cell:** Implement a function to generate and display side-by-side comparison charts for both depreciation methods (e.g., plotting both SL and DB depreciation expenses on one chart, and both NBV trends on another).
*   **Markdown Cell:** Explain the sensitivity of depreciation expense to changes in useful life and residual value estimates. Discuss how these choices impact net income, as elaborated in the "Sensitivity of Annual Depreciation Expense to Varying Estimates of Useful Life and Residual Value" example in the document.
*   **Markdown Cell:** Provide a final discussion on the implications for financial analysts, linking back to the "Implications for Financial Analysts: Expense Recognition" section, emphasizing how depreciation choices affect reported profitability and cash flows.

### **Section 7: Conclusion and Further Exploration**
*   **Markdown Cell (H1 Header):** "Conclusion and Next Steps"
*   **Markdown Cell:** Summarize the key takeaways and reinforce the learning objectives.
*   **Markdown Cell:** Suggest avenues for further exploration, such as:
    *   Implementing other depreciation methods (e.g., Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits, Units of Production).
    *   Analyzing the tax implications of different depreciation methods.
    *   Integrating with real-world financial data (e.g., from public company filings).

## 3. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

All mathematical content will be presented using proper LaTeX formatting.

### **3.1. General Depreciation Concept**
Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. This process matches the expense of using the asset with the revenue it helps generate.
From the provided document: "Depreciation is the process of systematically allocating costs of long-lived assets over the period during which the assets are expected to provide economic benefits." (Page 19)

### **3.2. Straight-Line Depreciation Method**
The straight-line method distributes the depreciable cost (cost minus residual value) of an asset evenly over each year of its useful life.
*   **Formula:**
    
$$
\text{Annual Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Estimated Useful Life}}
$$

    Where:
    *   $\text{Cost}$ is the initial acquisition cost of the asset.
    *   $\text{Residual Value}$ is the estimated salvage value at the end of the asset's useful life.
    *   $\text{Estimated Useful Life}$ is the number of years the asset is expected to be used.

### **3.3. Diminishing Balance Depreciation Method (Accelerated)**
The diminishing balance method applies a constant depreciation rate to the asset's *declining net book value* each year. This results in higher depreciation expense in the early years of the asset's life and lower expense in later years. The rate is typically a multiple of the straight-line rate.
*   **Step 1: Calculate Straight-Line Rate:**
    
$$
\text{Straight-Line Rate} = \frac{1}{\text{Useful Life}}
$$

*   **Step 2: Calculate Diminishing Balance Rate:**
    
$$
\text{Diminishing Balance Rate} = \text{Acceleration Factor} \times \text{Straight-Line Rate}
$$

    Where:
    *   $\text{Acceleration Factor}$ is a multiplier (e.g., $1.5$ for 150% declining balance, $2.0$ for double-declining balance).
*   **Step 3: Calculate Annual Depreciation Expense:**
    
$$
\text{Annual Depreciation Expense}_{\text{Year } t} = \text{Diminishing Balance Rate} \times \text{Net Book Value}_{\text{Beginning of Year } t}
$$

    **Key Constraint:** The asset should not be depreciated below its residual value. If the calculated depreciation for a given year would reduce the net book value below the residual value, the depreciation expense for that year is limited to the amount that brings the net book value exactly to the residual value.
    The `Net Book Value` at the beginning of Year $t$ is calculated as:
    
$$
\text{Net Book Value}_{\text{Beginning of Year } t} = \text{Cost} - \text{Accumulated Depreciation}_{\text{End of Year } t-1}
$$

## 4. Code Requirements

The code will be written in Python and primarily utilize standard data science libraries.

*   **Algorithms/Methods to be Implemented:**
    *   **Straight-Line Depreciation Function:**
        *   Inputs: `cost` (float), `useful_life` (int), `residual_value` (float).
        *   Logic: Calculate `depreciable_base`. Calculate `annual_depreciation_expense`. Iterate through years, subtracting `annual_depreciation_expense` from `net_book_value` until `useful_life` is reached or `net_book_value` hits `residual_value`.
        *   Output: Pandas DataFrame.
    *   **Diminishing Balance Depreciation Function:**
        *   Inputs: `cost` (float), `useful_life` (int), `residual_value` (float), `acceleration_factor` (float).
        *   Logic: Calculate `straight_line_rate` and `diminishing_balance_rate`. Initialize `current_book_value` to `cost`. Iterate through years:
            *   Calculate `depreciation_this_year = diminishing_balance_rate * current_book_value`.
            *   Ensure `depreciation_this_year` does not reduce `current_book_value` below `residual_value`. If `current_book_value - depreciation_this_year < residual_value`, then `depreciation_this_year = current_book_value - residual_value`.
            *   Update `current_book_value`.
        *   Output: Pandas DataFrame.
    *   **Interactive Control Function:**
        *   Takes inputs from `ipywidgets` (cost, useful life, residual value, acceleration factor, method choice).
        *   Calls the appropriate depreciation calculation function.
        *   Updates and displays the resulting DataFrame.
        *   Updates and displays the corresponding plots dynamically.

*   **Input/Output Expectations:**
    *   **Inputs:** All numerical inputs (`cost`, `useful_life`, `residual_value`, `acceleration_factor`) will be taken as floating-point or integer values. The depreciation `method_selector` will be a string.
    *   **Output (Data):** Pandas DataFrames will be the primary data output, presenting the annual depreciation schedules in a clear, tabular format.
    *   **Output (Visualizations):** Matplotlib or Plotly figures depicting the trends.

*   **Expected Libraries and Usage:**
    *   `pandas`: For creating and manipulating tabular data (depreciation schedules).
    *   `numpy`: For numerical operations if complex array manipulations are needed, though basic arithmetic should suffice.
    *   `matplotlib.pyplot`: For creating static or basic interactive plots (line charts). Can be used for annotations and basic tooltips.
    *   `ipywidgets`: Crucial for creating interactive user interface elements (sliders, text inputs, dropdowns) that allow users to change parameters and observe real-time updates in the calculations and plots.

## 5. Visualization and Output Expectations

The notebook will leverage visualizations to effectively communicate the dynamics of different depreciation methods.

*   **Charts, Tables, Plots to be Generated:**
    *   **Depreciation Schedule Tables:** For each chosen method, a clear pandas DataFrame will be displayed, showing:
        *   Year
        *   Beginning Net Book Value
        *   Annual Depreciation Expense
        *   Accumulated Depreciation
        *   Ending Net Book Value
    *   **Annual Depreciation Expense Plot (Line Chart):** A line chart illustrating the annual depreciation expense over the asset's useful life. This will clearly show the higher initial expense of accelerated methods compared to the constant expense of straight-line.
    *   **Net Book Value Plot (Line Chart):** A line chart showing the asset's net book value (carrying amount) over its useful life. This will visually represent the declining value of the asset on the balance sheet.
    *   **Comparative Plots:** Overlaying both straight-line and diminishing balance results on the same charts (one for expense, one for book value) to facilitate direct visual comparison. This will visually demonstrate the concept that "Under accelerated depreciation methods, there is a higher depreciation expense in early years relative to the straight-line method."

*   **Tools/Libraries Used for Visualization:**
    *   `matplotlib.pyplot`: Will be used for creating high-quality, customizable line charts.
    *   `ipywidgets`: Will be integrated to make the plots interactive, allowing real-time updates based on user inputs.
    *   Annotations and basic tooltips will be implemented using `matplotlib`'s annotation features or through the interactive capabilities of the selected plotting backend if using `plotly` or `bokeh` (though `matplotlib` for simplicity and avoiding external dependencies is preferred).

*   **Optional Interactivity via Widgets or Plots:**
    *   **Input Widgets:** Sliders for numerical inputs (cost, useful life, residual value, acceleration factor) and dropdowns for method selection will allow users to dynamically change parameters.
    *   **Dynamic Plot Updates:** Plots will automatically regenerate and update based on changes in input parameters from the widgets, providing immediate visual feedback.
    *   **Tooltips/Annotations:** Hover-over tooltips or static annotations will be added to plot points to display specific values (e.g., exact depreciation expense or book value for a given year), enhancing data interpretation.

## 6. Additional Notes or Instructions

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Assets are placed in service at the beginning of the fiscal year, simplifying annual calculations (no partial-year depreciation).
    *   The synthetic dataset generated for this notebook will mimic realistic financial characteristics (numeric values for cost, useful life, residual value; categorical for method selection).
    *   For the diminishing balance method, depreciation will cease once the asset's net book value reaches its residual value.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   The focus is strictly on straight-line and diminishing balance methods. Other depreciation methods are excluded to maintain clarity and focus on the learning objectives.
    *   The notebook will not include any deployment instructions or references to specific deployment platforms.
*   **Customization Instructions:**
    *   Users are encouraged to modify the initial default values for asset cost, useful life, and residual value to explore various scenarios.
    *   Experiment with different acceleration factors (e.g., 1.5 for 150%, 2.0 for 200%) for the diminishing balance method to observe their impact.
    *   The modular design (separate functions for each depreciation method) allows for easy extension by adding new depreciation algorithms if desired for advanced study.
*   **Built-in Guidance:** Clear markdown explanations will precede each code block, describing the purpose of the code, the variables used, and the expected output. Inline comments within the code will further explain complex logic where necessary.
*   **Relationship to Document:** The notebook directly supports the understanding of "Issues in Expense Recognition: Depreciation and Amortization" and "Implications for Financial Analysts: Expense Recognition" by providing a hands-on experience with the calculation and analysis of depreciation, a key component of expense recognition. This practical application solidifies the theoretical concepts presented in the document by demonstrating how different accounting choices and estimates (useful life, residual value, depreciation method) directly influence reported financial performance (expense and net income).

EXAMPLE 2: Alternative Inventory Costing Methods (Solution)
For KDL, the weighted average cost per unit would be
$321,600/7,600 units = $42.3158 per unit
Cost of goods sold using the weighted average cost method would be
5,600 units at $42.3158 = $236,968
Ending inventory using the weighted average cost method would be
2,000 units at $42.3158 = $84,632

EXAMPLE 4: An Illustration of Diminishing Balance Depreciation (Solution)
Depreciation expense for the first full year of use of the asset would be 40 percent of $11,000, or $4,400.
At the beginning of Year 2, the net book value is measured as:
Asset cost                        $11,000
Less: Accumulated depreciation     (4,400)
Net book value                    $6,600

For the second full year, depreciation expense would be $6,600 × 40 percent, or $2,640.
At the end of the second year (i.e., beginning of the third year), a total of $7,040 ($4,400 + $2,640) of depreciation would have been recorded.
The remaining net book value at the beginning of the third year would be:
Asset cost                        $11,000
Less: Accumulated depreciation     (7,040)
Net book value                    $3,960

For the third full year, depreciation would be $3,960 × 40 percent, or $1,584.
At the end of the third year, a total of $8,624 ($4,400 + $2,640 + $1,584) of depreciation would have been recorded.
So, the remaining net book value at the beginning of the fourth year would be:
Asset cost                        $11,000
Less: Accumulated depreciation     (8,624)
Net book value                    $2,376

For the fourth full year, depreciation would be $2,376 × 40 percent, or $950.
At the end of the fourth year, a total of $9,574 ($4,400 + $2,640 + $1,584 + $950) of depreciation would have been recorded.
So, the remaining net book value at the beginning of the fifth year would be:
Asset cost                        $11,000
Less: Accumulated depreciation     (9,574)
Net book value                    $1,426

For the fifth year, if deprecation were determined as in previous years, it would amount to $570 ($1,426 × 40 percent). However, this would result in a remaining net book value of the asset below its estimated residual value of $1,000. So, instead, only $426 would be depreciated, leaving a $1,000 net book value at the end of the fifth year.
Asset cost                        $11,000
Less: Accumulated depreciation     (10,000)
Net book value                    $1,000

Solution for EXAMPLE 5 (Microsoft Corporation):
For 2017, the net profit margin is 26.4% (= 25,489/96,571) under the new standard versus 23.6% (= 21,204/89,950) under the old standard. Reported revenue grew faster under the new standard. Revenue growth under the new standard was 5.9% [= (96,571/91,154) – 1] compared to 5.4% [= (89,950/85,320) – 1)] under the old standard.

Basic EPS Formula:
Basic EPS = (Net income - Preferred dividends) / Weighted average number of shares outstanding

EXAMPLE 6: A Basic EPS Calculation (1) (Solution)
Shopalot's basic EPS is $1.30 ($1,950,000 divided by 1,500,000 shares).

EXAMPLE 7: A Basic EPS Calculation (2)
Common stock share information:
| Category                         | Shares     |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| Shares outstanding on 1 January 2018 | 1,000,000  |
| Shares issued on 1 April 2018    | 200,000    |
| Shares repurchased (treasury shares) on 1 October 2018 | (100,000)  |
| Shares outstanding on 31 December 2018 | 1,100,000  |

Solution to 1 (EXAMPLE 7):
The weighted average number of shares outstanding is determined by the length of time each quantity of shares was outstanding:
1,000,000 x (3 months/12 months) = 250,000
1,200,000 × (6 months/12 months) = 600,000
1,100,000 x (3 months/12 months) = 275,000
Weighted average number of shares outstanding = 1,125,000

Solution to 2 (EXAMPLE 7):
Basic EPS = (Net income – Preferred dividends) / Weighted average number of shares = ($2,500,000 – $200,000)/1,125,000 = $2.04

EXAMPLE 8: A Basic EPS Calculation (3) (Solution)
For EPS calculation purposes, a stock split is treated as if it occurred at the beginning of the period. The weighted average number of shares would, therefore, be 2,250,000, and the basic EPS would be $1.02 [= ($2,500,000 – $200,000)/2,250,000].

Diluted EPS Formula (Preferred Stock):
Diluted EPS = (Net income) / (Weighted average number of shares outstanding + New common shares that would have been issued at conversion)

Diluted EPS Formula (Convertible Debt):
Diluted EPS = (Net income + After-tax interest on convertible debt - Preferred dividends) / (Weighted average number of shares outstanding + Additional common shares that would have been issued at conversion)

EXAMPLE 10: A Diluted EPS Calculation Using the If-Converted Method for Convertible Debt (Solution)
If the debt securities had been converted, the company would not have paid interest of $3,000 on the convertible debt, so net income available to common shareholders would have increased by $2,100 [= $3,000(1 – 0.30)] on an after-tax basis.

Diluted EPS Formula (Treasury Stock Method for Options):
Diluted EPS = (Net income - Preferred dividends) / [Weighted average number of shares outstanding + (New shares that would have been issued at option exercise - Shares that could have been purchased with cash received upon exercise) x (Proportion of year during which the financial instruments were outstanding)]

EXAMPLE 11: A Diluted EPS Calculation Using the Treasury Stock Method for Options (Solution)
Company would have received $1,050,000 ($35 for each of the 30,000 options exercised).
Company could have repurchased 19,091 shares ($1,050,000 proceeds / $55 market price).
Incremental number of shares issued is 10,909 (calculated as 30,000 minus 19,091).

EXAMPLE 12: Diluted EPS for Options under IFRS (Solution)
If the options had been exercised, the company would have received $1,050,000.
If this amount had been received from the issuance of new shares at the average market price of $55 per share, the company would have issued 19,091 shares.
The number of shares issued under options (30,000) minus the number of inferred shares (19,091) equals 10,909.
This amount is added to the weighted average number of shares outstanding of 800,000 to get diluted shares of 810,909.

EXAMPLE 13: An Antidilutive Security (Solution)
If the 20,000 shares of convertible preferred had each converted into 3 shares of the company's common stock, the company would have had an additional 60,000 shares of common stock.
If the conversion had taken place, the company would not have paid preferred dividends of $200,000 ($10 per share for each of the 20,000 shares of preferred).
The effect of using the if-converted method would be EPS of $3.13, as shown in Exhibit 14.

Solution to Question 8 (Page 56):
Under the first in, first out (FIFO) method, the first 10,000 units sold came from the October purchases at £10, and the next 2,000 units sold came from the November purchases at £11.
Cost of goods sold = (10,000 units * £10/unit) + (2,000 units * £11/unit) = £100,000 + £22,000 = £122,000.

Solution to Question 9 (Page 56):
Under the weighted average cost method:
| Category          | Units        | Cost         |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| October purchases | 10,000 units | $100,000     |
| November purchases | 5,000 units  | $55,000      |
| Total             | 15,000 units | $155,000     |

Weighted average cost per unit = $155,000 / 15,000 units = $10.3333 per unit
Cost of goods sold = $10.3333 × 12,000 units = $124,000

Solution to Question 16 (Page 57):
Weighted average number of shares outstanding for 2009 is:
(1,000,000 shares * 6/12 months) + (1,100,000 shares * 6/12 months) = 500,000 + 550,000 = 1,050,000 shares.
Basic earnings per share = Net income / Weighted average shares outstanding
= $1,000,000 / 1,050,000 = $0.95.

Solution to Question 18 (Page 57):
Diluted EPS = (Net income) / (Weighted average number of shares outstanding + New common shares that would have been issued at conversion)
= $200,000,000 / [50,000,000 + (2,000,000 preferred shares × 2 common shares/preferred share)]
= $200,000,000 / [50,000,000 + 4,000,000]
= $200,000,000 / 54,000,000 = $3.70

Solution to Question 19 (Page 57):
Diluted EPS = (Net income – Preferred dividends) / [Weighted average number of shares outstanding + (New shares that would have been issued at option exercise – Shares that could have been purchased with cash received upon exercise) × (Proportion of year during which the financial instruments were outstanding)]
Proceeds from option exercise = 100,000 options × $20/option = $2,000,000
Shares repurchased = $2,000,000 proceeds / $25 market price = 80,000 shares
Net increase in shares outstanding = 100,000 (issued) – 80,000 (repurchased) = 20,000 shares
Diluted EPS for CWC = ($12,000,000 – $800,000) / (2,000,000 + 20,000)
= $11,200,000 / 2,020,000 = $5.54

Solution to Question 20 (Page 57):
LB's basic EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Stock Dividends Paid) / Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding
= ($3,350,000 – $430,000) / 2,400,000
= $2,920,000 / 2,400,000 = $1.22
(The weighted average number of shares is 2,020,000 + 380,000 = 2,400,000, as stock dividends are retroactively applied to the beginning of the period.)

Solution to Question 21 (Page 58):
With stock options, the treasury stock method must be used.
Proceeds from exercise = 10,000 options × $10/option = $100,000
Shares repurchased = $100,000 proceeds / $15 average market price = 6,667 shares
Shares to be added to denominator for diluted EPS: 10,000 (exercised) – 6,667 (repurchased) = 3,333 shares
Denominator for diluted EPS = 1,000,000 (average outstanding) + 3,333 (incremental) = 1,003,333 shares
| Category                  | Shares     |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Shares outstanding        | 1,000,000  |
| Options exercises         | 10,000     |
| Treasury shares purchased | (6,667)    |
| Denominator               | 1,003,333  |

Solution to Question 24 (Page 58):
Comprehensive income includes both net income and other comprehensive income.
Other comprehensive income = Unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities – Unrealized loss on derivatives accounted for as hedges + Foreign currency translation gain on consolidation
= $5 million – $3 million + $2 million
= $4 million

Alternatively,
Comprehensive income – Net income = Other comprehensive income
Comprehensive income = (Ending shareholders equity – Beginning shareholders equity) + Dividends
= ($493 million – $475 million) + $1 million
= $18 million + $1 million = $19 million
Net income is $15 million so other comprehensive income is $4 million.
