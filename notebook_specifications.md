## 1. Notebook Overview

### Purpose and Objectives
This Jupyter Notebook serves as an interactive educational tool designed to elucidate the concept of depreciation and facilitate the calculation and comparison of different depreciation methods. It aims to provide a hands-on experience for understanding how the cost of long-lived assets is systematically allocated over their useful life and the implications of different accounting choices.

### Target Users and Learning Goals
The primary target users are finance and accounting students, or anyone seeking to understand the principles of long-lived asset accounting.
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Gain a clear understanding of the key insights derived from financial accounting principles related to expense recognition.
- **Understand the concept of "depreciation"** as the systematic allocation of costs of long-lived physical assets over their useful life, as defined in the uploaded document's "Issues in Expense Recognition: Depreciation and Amortization" section.
- **Calculate annual depreciation expense using the straight-line method**, which allocates cost less residual value evenly over the useful life, using the formula:
    $$ \text{Annual Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual value}}{\text{Estimated useful life}} $$
    as presented in the document's example on "Sensitivity of Annual Depreciation Expense to Varying Estimates of Useful Life and Residual Value."
- **Calculate depreciation using an accelerated method** like the diminishing balance method, which applies a constant rate to the declining net book value of the asset, as illustrated in the document's "An Illustration of Diminishing Balance Depreciation" example.
- **Analyze the sensitivity of depreciation expense** to changes in estimated useful life and residual value, as highlighted in the document's "Sensitivity of Annual Depreciation Expense to Varying Estimates of Useful Life and Residual Value" example and its accompanying exhibit.

### Expected Outcomes and Value
Users will be able to:
- Input asset parameters and instantly generate depreciation schedules.
- Visualize the annual depreciation expense and net book value for different methods over time.
- Compare the impact of straight-line vs. accelerated depreciation on financial statements.
- Develop a deeper understanding of how key estimates (useful life, residual value) and method choices impact reported expense and net income.

## 3. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

This section will detail the core financial accounting concepts and the mathematical formulas underpinning the depreciation calculations. All mathematical content will strictly adhere to LaTeX formatting requirements.

### Depreciation Concept
Depreciation is an accounting method of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life or life expectancy. It represents how much of an asset's value has been used up. The purpose of depreciation is to systematically reduce the book value of an asset as it ages and loses value, thereby matching the expense of the asset to the revenue it helps generate.

As stated in the document's "Issues in Expense Recognition: Depreciation and Amortization" section, "Depreciation is the process of systematically allocating costs of long-lived assets over the period during which the assets are expected to provide economic benefits."

### Straight-Line Depreciation Method
The straight-line depreciation method allocates the depreciable cost of an asset evenly over its estimated useful life. This results in the same amount of depreciation expense being recorded each year.

**Key Terms:**
-   **Cost ($C$)**: The initial purchase price of the asset.
-   **Residual Value ($RV$)**: The estimated salvage value of the asset at the end of its useful life. This is the amount the company expects to receive upon sale of the asset at the end of its useful life.
-   **Depreciable Base**: The portion of the asset's cost that will be depreciated, calculated as $C - RV$.
-   **Estimated Useful Life ($N$)**: The number of years the asset is expected to be used.

**Formula for Annual Depreciation Expense:**
The annual depreciation expense using the straight-line method is calculated as:
$$ \text{Annual Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual value}}{\text{Estimated useful life}} $$
Or, using the defined terms:
$$ D_{SL} = \frac{C - RV}{N} $$

**Net Book Value ($NBV$) Calculation:**
The Net Book Value at the end of year $t$ is calculated as the initial cost minus the accumulated depreciation up to year $t$:
$$ NBV_t = C - (D_{SL} \times t) $$
The accumulated depreciation at the end of year $t$ is $AD_t = D_{SL} \times t$.

### Diminishing Balance Depreciation Method (Accelerated Depreciation)
The diminishing balance method, also known as the declining balance method, is an accelerated depreciation method. This means it records a higher depreciation expense in the early years of an asset's life and a lower expense in later years. This method applies a constant depreciation rate to the asset's declining net book value each period.

As illustrated in the document's "An Illustration of Diminishing Balance Depreciation" example, this method applies a constant rate to the declining net book value of the asset.

**Key Terms:**
-   **Straight-Line Rate ($R_{SL}$)**: The annual depreciation rate if the straight-line method were used, calculated as $1/N$.
-   **Acceleration Factor ($F$)**: A multiplier applied to the straight-line rate to accelerate depreciation. Common factors are $1.5$ (150%) or $2.0$ (200%, often called "Double Declining Balance").
-   **Diminishing Balance Rate ($R_{DB}$)**: The accelerated depreciation rate, calculated as $F \times R_{SL}$.

**Formula for Annual Depreciation Expense:**
The annual depreciation expense for year $t$ ($D_t$) is calculated by applying the diminishing balance rate to the net book value at the beginning of the year ($NBV_{t-1}$):
$$ D_t = R_{DB} \times NBV_{t-1} $$

**Important Considerations:**
-   Unlike the straight-line method, the residual value is generally *not* subtracted from the cost to determine the depreciable base at the beginning. The depreciation rate is applied to the full book value.
-   However, depreciation stops once the asset's net book value reaches its estimated residual value ($RV$). The depreciation in the final year must be adjusted to ensure the $NBV$ does not fall below $RV$. If $R_{DB} \times NBV_{t-1}$ would result in $NBV_t < RV$, then $D_t$ is capped at $NBV_{t-1} - RV$.

The document states, "Under accelerated depreciation methods, there is a higher depreciation expense in early years relative to the straight-line method," which this notebook will visually demonstrate.

## 4. Code Requirements

This section specifies the Python algorithms, input/output structures, and libraries required to implement the depreciation analysis.

### Required Libraries
-   `pandas`: For efficient data manipulation and creation of tabular depreciation schedules.
-   `matplotlib.pyplot`: For generating static line plots to visualize depreciation trends.
-   `ipywidgets`: For creating interactive input elements (sliders, dropdowns) within the Jupyter Notebook environment.

### Algorithms and Methods to be Implemented

#### 4.1. Input Parameters (via `ipywidgets`)
The notebook will feature interactive sliders and text fields to allow users to dynamically adjust key asset parameters:
-   `asset_cost`: Initial cost of the asset (e.g., `FloatSlider(min=1000, max=100000, step=1000, value=10000, description='Asset Cost:')`)
-   `useful_life`: Estimated useful life in years (e.g., `IntSlider(min=1, max=20, step=1, value=5, description='Useful Life (Years):')`)
-   `residual_value`: Estimated residual or salvage value at the end of useful life (e.g., `FloatSlider(min=0, max=50000, step=500, value=1000, description='Residual Value:')`)
-   `acceleration_factor`: Multiplier for the diminishing balance method (e.g., `FloatSlider(min=1.0, max=2.0, step=0.1, value=2.0, description='Acceleration Factor (DB):')`)
-   `selected_method`: A dropdown or radio button to choose between "Straight-Line" and "Diminishing Balance" for detailed view or a "Comparison" option.

#### 4.2. `calculate_straight_line_depreciation(cost, residual_value, useful_life)` Function
-   **Purpose**: Computes the annual depreciation expense and book values for an asset using the straight-line method.
-   **Inputs**: `cost` (float), `residual_value` (float), `useful_life` (int).
-   **Logic**:
    1.  Calculate `depreciable_base = cost - residual_value`.
    2.  Calculate `annual_depreciation = depreciable_base / useful_life`.
    3.  Initialize lists for `year`, `beginning_book_value`, `annual_depreciation_expense`, `accumulated_depreciation`, `ending_book_value`.
    4.  Loop from `year = 1` to `useful_life`:
        a.  Determine `beginning_book_value` for the current year.
        b.  The `annual_depreciation_expense` is constant.
        c.  Calculate `accumulated_depreciation` (previous accumulated + current annual).
        d.  Calculate `ending_book_value` (`cost - accumulated_depreciation`).
    5.  Handle edge case: if `annual_depreciation` makes `ending_book_value` go below `residual_value` in the final year, cap the final year's depreciation to bring `ending_book_value` exactly to `residual_value`.
    6.  Create a `pandas.DataFrame` from the collected data.
-   **Output Expectations**: A `pandas.DataFrame` with columns: `Year`, `Beginning Book Value`, `Annual Depreciation Expense`, `Accumulated Depreciation`, `Ending Net Book Value`.

#### 4.3. `calculate_diminishing_balance_depreciation(cost, residual_value, useful_life, acceleration_factor)` Function
-   **Purpose**: Computes the annual depreciation expense and book values for an asset using the diminishing balance method.
-   **Inputs**: `cost` (float), `residual_value` (float), `useful_life` (int), `acceleration_factor` (float).
-   **Logic**:
    1.  Calculate `straight_line_rate = 1 / useful_life`.
    2.  Calculate `depreciation_rate = straight_line_rate * acceleration_factor`.
    3.  Initialize lists for `year`, `beginning_book_value`, `annual_depreciation_expense`, `accumulated_depreciation`, `ending_book_value`.
    4.  Set `current_book_value = cost`.
    5.  Loop from `year = 1` to `useful_life`:
        a.  Set `beginning_book_value` for the current year to `current_book_value`.
        b.  Calculate `calculated_depreciation = current_book_value * depreciation_rate`.
        c.  Determine `depreciation_for_year`:
            i.  If `current_book_value - calculated_depreciation < residual_value`, then `depreciation_for_year = current_book_value - residual_value` (to ensure `NBV` does not drop below `RV`).
            ii. Else, `depreciation_for_year = calculated_depreciation`.
        d.  Update `current_book_value = current_book_value - depreciation_for_year`.
        e.  Update `accumulated_depreciation`.
    6.  Create a `pandas.DataFrame` from the collected data.

#### 4.4. Helper Functions for Display and Plotting
-   `display_schedule(dataframe, title)`: A simple function to display a DataFrame clearly with a given title.
-   `plot_depreciation_trends(df_sl, df_db=None, asset_cost, title="")`:
    -   Handles plotting of annual depreciation and net book value.
    -   Can plot single method or compare two methods.

### Input/Output Expectations
-   **Inputs**: All inputs will be numeric (float or int), provided via interactive widgets.
-   **Outputs**:
    -   Tabular data (`pandas.DataFrame`) showing yearly breakdown of depreciation.
    -   Visualizations (`matplotlib` plots) representing the trends of annual depreciation and net book value over the asset's life.

### Expected Libraries and How They Will Be Used
-   `pandas`: Used for creating and managing structured data (depreciation schedules). This allows for easy display and manipulation of the yearly financial figures.
-   `matplotlib.pyplot`: Used for generating static plots (line charts). It will visualize the trends of depreciation expense and net book value over time, enabling visual comparison of methods.
-   `ipywidgets`: Crucial for creating the interactive user interface. It will enable users to modify asset parameters (cost, life, residual value, acceleration factor) using sliders and dropdowns, with the results updating in real-time, facilitating dynamic scenario analysis.

## 5. Visualization and Output Expectations

The notebook will provide clear and insightful visual and tabular outputs to help users understand the impact of different depreciation methods.

### Charts, Tables, Plots that Should Be Generated

#### 5.1. Tabular Output (Pandas DataFrames)
For each selected depreciation method (straight-line, diminishing balance), a detailed schedule will be presented in a `pandas.DataFrame`.
-   **Table Columns**:
    -   `Year`: The year of the asset's useful life (e.g., 1, 2, 3...).
    -   `Beginning Book Value`: The asset's net book value at the start of the year.
    -   `Annual Depreciation Expense`: The depreciation amount recognized for that specific year.
    -   `Accumulated Depreciation`: The total depreciation expense recognized from the start of the asset's life up to the end of the current year.
    -   `Ending Net Book Value`: The asset's net book value at the end of the year (Beginning Book Value - Annual Depreciation Expense).

#### 5.2. Visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn Line Charts)

**Individual Method Plots**:
For each depreciation method, separate line charts will be generated:
-   **Chart 1: Annual Depreciation Expense over Time**
    -   X-axis: Year
    -   Y-axis: Annual Depreciation Expense
    -   This plot will clearly show the constant expense for straight-line and the declining expense for diminishing balance.
-   **Chart 2: Net Book Value over Time**
    -   X-axis: Year
    -   Y-axis: Net Book Value
    -   This plot will show the linear decline for straight-line and the curvilinear (faster initial) decline for diminishing balance. Both lines should converge towards the residual value.

**Comparative Plots**:
In a dedicated comparison section, both methods will be plotted on the same graph to facilitate side-by-side analysis.
-   **Chart 3: Comparison of Annual Depreciation Expense**
    -   Two lines: one for Straight-Line, one for Diminishing Balance.
    -   Visually demonstrates that "Under accelerated depreciation methods, there is a higher depreciation expense in early years relative to the straight-line method," as stated in the document.
-   **Chart 4: Comparison of Net Book Value**
    -   Two lines: one for Straight-Line, one for Diminishing Balance.
    -   Shows how the asset's carrying amount differs over time under different methods.

### Tools/Libraries Used for Visualization
-   `matplotlib.pyplot` will be the primary library for creating all plots. `seaborn` could be used optionally for enhanced aesthetics, but `matplotlib` is sufficient.

### Optional Interactivity via Widgets or Plots
Interactivity will be a core component of this notebook, implemented using `ipywidgets`.
-   **Input Widgets**: Sliders for `asset_cost`, `useful_life`, `residual_value`, and `acceleration_factor`.
-   **Method Selector**: A `Dropdown` or `RadioButtons` widget to select which depreciation method's detailed schedule and individual plots are displayed, or to trigger the comparative plots.
-   **Dynamic Updates**: The `ipywidgets.interact` function will be used to link the input widgets to the calculation and plotting functions. This ensures that as the user adjusts any parameter, the depreciation schedules (tables) and charts automatically update in real-time, providing immediate feedback and enabling dynamic scenario analysis and "sensitivity analysis of depreciation expense to changes in estimated useful life and residual value."

## 6. Additional Notes or Instructions

### Assumptions
-   **Full Year Depreciation**: For simplicity, all depreciation calculations assume the asset is put into service at the beginning of the fiscal year, and a full year's depreciation is calculated for each year of its useful life. Pro-rata depreciation for partial years is not included.
-   **No Impairment or Revaluation**: The notebook does not account for asset impairment or revaluation models, focusing solely on the cost model for depreciation as the primary method discussed in the document for US GAAP and common IFRS practice.
-   **Synthetic Dataset**: The calculations will be based on user-provided synthetic inputs, rather than external datasets. This aligns with the `datasetType: Synthetic` requirement.

### Constraints
-   **Positive Useful Life**: The `useful_life` input must be a positive integer.
-   **Residual Value Limit**: The `residual_value` must be less than or equal to the `asset_cost`.
-   **Acceleration Factor Range**: The `acceleration_factor` for diminishing balance should typically be between 1.0 and 2.0. The code should ideally include validation or visual cues if inputs fall outside sensible ranges.

### Customization Instructions
-   **Modifying Initial Parameters**: Users are encouraged to experiment with the `ipywidgets` to change the `asset_cost`, `useful_life`, `residual_value`, and `acceleration_factor` to observe how these changes impact the depreciation schedules and net book value. This directly supports the "User Interaction" requirement.
-   **Extending to Other Methods**: The modular structure of the Python functions (e.g., `calculate_straight_line_depreciation`, `calculate_diminishing_balance_depreciation`) makes it straightforward for advanced users to add new depreciation methods (e.g., Sum-of-the-Years' Digits, Units of Production) by creating new functions and integrating them into the interactive interface.
-   **Enhancing Visualizations**: Users can customize plot aesthetics (colors, labels, legends) by modifying the `matplotlib` code within the `plot_depreciation_trends` function. Annotations and tooltips, while not directly implemented as `ipywidgets` on the plots, can be added programmatically in `matplotlib` for more detailed insights.

### Relation of the lab to the concept:
This application directly addresses the document's "Issues in Expense Recognition: Depreciation and Amortization" section by providing a practical, interactive environment for users to calculate and understand depreciation under various methods. By allowing users to manipulate key estimates (useful life, residual value) and method choices, it highlights their direct impact on the reported expense and, consequently, a company's net income, echoing the discussions in the document's "Implications for Financial Analysts: Expense Recognition" section. It serves as an active learning tool that transforms theoretical concepts into tangible, explorable outcomes.
